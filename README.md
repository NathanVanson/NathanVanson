# Oh, hello there 👋 !

I am a bachelor student in computer science at the university of Geneva (UNIGE). In spite of the immense laziness that I possess, I try at least to learn and to improve myself (lol) in the programming languages

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C, Matlab and soon Java (for the 2nd semester)

### Current Programming Language 💻

- Python 🐍
- C 🇨
- Swift (wtf is that ?!) 🐤
- MatLab 🧮

### Activities 📋

- Video Games (Monster Hunter Speedrunner, RL C2) 🎮
- Anime 🌄
- Sport -> Basketball 🏀🏊
- Music (Spotify always) 🎧
- Youtube (For record MH or RocketLeague) 🎬
